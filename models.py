"""A small CNN backbone + three heads, one per stage of the pathway.

We deliberately swap the repo's ResNet50+CBAM for a compact CNN so an epoch is
seconds on MPS and you can iterate on the *ideas*. The head shapes are what
carry the lessons:

  FlatModel        backbone -> 100                      (no hierarchy at all)
  TwoHeadModel     backbone -> {20, 100}                (deep supervision / lloss)
  CoarseToFineModel backbone -> 20, then cat(20,100)->100  (the repo's conditioning)

Every model exposes `.features(x)` returning the pooled penultimate vector, so
Stage 5 can watch the representation organize by superclass.

        level_2 = softmax_reg2(cat(level_1, linear_lvl2(z)))  # cat(20,100) -> 100

    Why concatenating-then-one-Linear is genuinely "conditioning", in one line of
    block-matrix algebra. Write the fine head's weight W (100 x 120) as two blocks
    side by side, W = [A | B] with A of shape 100x20 and B of shape 100x100. Then

        W @ [level_1 ; linear_lvl2(z)] + b  =  A @ level_1  +  B @ linear_lvl2(z) + b

    Concatenating the inputs and applying ONE linear map is identically equal to
    applying two separate linear maps and adding. So the fine logits are the usual
    feature-driven logits (B term) plus a learned correction driven purely by the
    coarse opinion (A term). Column j of A is exactly "how believing in superclass
    j shifts every fine logit" -- the model can learn to add evidence to the five
    children of the predicted parent and subtract it elsewhere.

    Note this is an additive, linear coupling: it biases the fine logits but
    cannot *forbid* an inconsistent answer, which is why the architecture alone
    does not drive the violation rate to zero and the loss still has work to do.

    We return raw logits and let the loss apply softmax -- matching their
    pre-softmax concatenation, and keeping the numerically stable fused
    log-softmax inside cross_entropy rather than doing softmax twice.

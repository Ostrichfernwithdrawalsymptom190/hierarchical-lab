"""Stage 4 — the intellectual core.

Part A (the proof): their dependency loss `dloss` is built from argmax + `==` +
where. We run it once and show it has NO gradient path — `requires_grad` is
False, so it cannot even .backward(). It's a monitoring number wearing a loss's
clothes. Then we show SoftHierarchyLoss DOES push gradient into the trunk.

Part B (the experiment): train four identical CoarseToFineModels, same seed and
same data order, and compare the hierarchy-violation curve:

    1. lloss only            baseline, no consistency pressure
    2. lloss + their dloss   dead term; trajectory is IDENTICAL to #1
    3. lloss + soft loss     ties the fine head to the TRUE parent
    4. lloss + agreement KL  ties the two heads to EACH OTHER

Measured result (6 epochs, seed 0 — see the README table): #2 matches #1 to the
last decimal, confirming the dead gradient. #3 does NOT improve the violation
rate, and that negative result is the interesting part: it optimizes fine-vs-
truth consistency while the metric measures fine-vs-coarse-head agreement, so it
can be satisfied while the heads still contradict each other. #4 is the variant
that puts the measured quantity itself into the objective.

The lesson is bigger than the loss: a plausible-sounding regularizer that is
differentiable and correct can still fail, simply because it does not optimize
the thing you are measuring. Check that link before trusting the mechanism.

    """Part A — demonstrate the dead gradient, then a live one.

    What to watch for. Autograd records a graph only over differentiable ops; the
    node that produced a tensor is stored in `.grad_fn`. argmax and `==` return
    tensors with no grad_fn, because they are piecewise-constant: perturb a logit
    infinitesimally and the output does not move, so the derivative is 0 almost
    everywhere and undefined at the jumps. PyTorch does not raise -- it simply
    hands back a tensor detached from the graph, which is why this bug survives
    code review and a loss curve that looks perfectly reasonable.

    The tell is `requires_grad=False` on a quantity you are about to add to your
    objective. Adding a constant to a loss changes its printed value while leaving
    every gradient identical, so the training run looks fine and learns nothing
    from that term. Part B measures the consequence.

    The intent is right: charge the network extra when the fine prediction is not
    a child of the coarse prediction. The execution kills it. Every quantity below
    is obtained by argmax or by an equality test, and both are *piecewise-constant*
    functions of the logits: nudge a logit by a hair and the argmax does not move,
    so the derivative is 0 almost everywhere (and undefined at the jumps). A
    function that is flat almost everywhere transmits no information to gradient
    descent. Autograd reports this honestly by never building a graph node at all,
    so the returned tensor has requires_grad=False and cannot even .backward().

    Two pieces of algebra worth seeing:

      p^(D*l_prev) * p^(D*l_curr) = p^(D*(l_prev + l_curr))

    so the penalty only depends on D times the NUMBER of wrong levels: it takes
    the values {0, 2, 8} for p=3, namely p^0-1, p^1-1, p^2-1. And note D=1 forces
    at least one level to be wrong: if both predictions were correct, the fine
    truth's parent is the coarse truth by construction, so the pair would be
    consistent and D would be 0. The penalty is therefore only ever charged on

    The idea that makes this differentiable: stop asking "which class won?" and
    start asking "how much probability landed in the right block?". The first is
    a step function; the second is smooth in every logit.

    The linear algebra. Let M be the (20 x 100) membership matrix with
    M[c, f] = 1 exactly when fine class f is a child of coarse class c. Each
    column holds a single 1 (one parent per child), so M is the one-hot encoding
    of parenthood. For a probability row-vector p over the 100 fine classes,

        p @ M.T   ->   a 20-vector whose c-th entry is  sum_{f in children(c)} p_f

    which is exactly the marginal probability of the parent. So marginalizing a
    distribution up a tree IS a matrix product against the membership matrix; the
    tree structure lives entirely in M. Grouping/aggregation and matrix
    multiplication are the same operation here.

    Why compute it in log-space instead of literally doing `probs @ M.T`. The
    quantity we want is

        -log sum_{f in children(c)} exp(z_f) / sum_j exp(z_j)

    Forming the probabilities first, summing, then taking a log invites underflow:
    if the mass in the parent is ~1e-45 the sum flushes to 0 and the log returns
    -inf (the usual patch is to add an epsilon, which silently caps the loss and
    biases the gradient). Instead we take log_softmax, which computes
    z - logsumexp(z) with the max subtracted internally, then reduce the children
    with torch.logsumexp. logsumexp(x) = max(x) + log sum exp(x - max(x)) never
    overflows and stays exact deep into the tail, so no epsilon is needed and the
    gradient is right even when the model is confidently wrong -- which is exactly
    when this loss has the most to say.

    We select the children with masked_fill(-inf) rather than multiplying by M:
    exp(-inf) = 0 contributes nothing to the sum, whereas multiplying probabilities
    by a 0/1 mask would put a hard zero *inside* a log.

class HeadAgreementLoss(nn.Module):
    """L = KL( fine-marginalized parent distribution || coarse head distribution ).

    Why this exists, and why SoftHierarchyLoss was not enough. Measured on
    CIFAR-100, adding SoftHierarchyLoss did NOT reduce the head-disagreement rate
    (see the Results table in the README). The reason is a mismatch between what
    that loss optimizes and what `violation_rate` measures:

        SoftHierarchyLoss  ties the fine distribution to the TRUE parent label.
        violation_rate     compares the fine prediction's parent against the
                           COARSE HEAD's prediction -- the truth never appears.

    So the first loss can be fully satisfied while the two heads still contradict
    each other. To move a metric you must put that metric's own quantity in the
    objective. Here both distributions over the 20 parents are compared directly:

        m = marginalized fine distribution   (fine probs summed within each parent)
        c = coarse head's own distribution
        L = KL(m || c) = sum_p m_p * (log m_p - log c_p)

    KL is not symmetric, and the direction is a modelling choice. KL(m || c)
    weights each term by m, so it punishes hardest where the FINE head is
    confident and the coarse head disagrees -- it pulls the coarse head toward
    the fine head's (100-way, more specific) evidence. The reverse direction would
    do the opposite. Gradient flows into both heads, so they meet rather than one
    chasing the other.

    Everything is computed from log-probabilities for the same reason as above:
    m_p is a sum over children, which is a logsumexp in log-space, and KL needs
    log m and log c anyway. Forming probabilities first would only add underflow.

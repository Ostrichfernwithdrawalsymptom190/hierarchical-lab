"""The takeaway toolkit — dataset-agnostic structured-output helpers.

Everything in the pathway that's worth keeping, distilled into one file with no
CIFAR/torchvision dependency. Point it at ANY two-level taxonomy: pass a
`child_to_parent` list (child_to_parent[fine_id] = coarse_id) and you get a
differentiable "respect the tree" loss and a violation metric.

Where this applies in your future work
---------------------------------------
Any time you know structure among your outputs and want the model to honor it:
  * LLM classification/routing over a label taxonomy (intent -> sub-intent).
  * Cascaded / coarse-to-fine decoders (predict the region, then the point).
  * Product / document categorization, ICD codes, any ontology.
The pattern: (1) share a trunk, (2) supervise every level, (3) enforce
consistency by MARGINALIZING the fine distribution up to the parent and making
that agree with the coarse target — differentiably. Never enforce it with
argmax; argmax has no gradient (see faithful_dloss in losses.py for the trap).

        loss = -log( probability mass the model placed inside the TRUE parent )

    The design decision worth copying: measure MASS, not the winner. "Is the
    argmax child under the right parent?" is a step function of the logits -- flat
    almost everywhere, so its gradient is zero and it teaches nothing. "How much
    probability landed in the right group?" varies smoothly with every logit, so
    gradient descent can act on it.

    Computed in log-space. The definition is

        -log sum_{c in children(p)} exp(z_c) / sum_j exp(z_j)

    Building probabilities first and then taking a log underflows: once the mass
    in the parent drops below ~1e-45 the sum is exactly 0 in float32 and the log
    is -inf, which is usually patched with an epsilon that quietly caps the loss
    and biases the gradient. log_softmax followed by logsumexp subtracts the max
    internally, so it is exact far into the tail and needs no epsilon -- and the
    tail is exactly where a confidently-wrong model lives.

    Children are selected with masked_fill(-inf) instead of multiplying by M,
    because exp(-inf)=0 drops those terms from the sum cleanly, whereas masking
    probabilities to 0 would place a hard zero inside a logarithm.
